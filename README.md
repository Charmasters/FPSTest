This project was coded in Javascript for the fall semester of my highschool mechatronics class. The project is stored on code.org.

This project was made to test my coding ability in Javascript. I attempted to recreate a 3D video game as a broser based project. I found raycasting to be to expensive and low quality for this project, so instead represented everything in terms of rectangular prisims. The game does not render varying z levels, so only uses trigonometry to render a 2D grid onto a view port. Much time was spent attempting to improve performance, but most were unsuccessful. They included: limiting the rendered squares to what would be viewed, stopping rendering once the viewport is filled, rendering only visible faces, and others. 

The project was an interesting one, but was inefficient on multiple levels. Too much time was spent trying to make the project efficient rather than adding content. I also found that trigonometry was an inneficient method of performing the math rather than using vector math, as is more common for this purpose.
